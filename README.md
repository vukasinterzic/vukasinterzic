### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vukasin. I am a digital nomad traveling around the world, while working as a Cloud Solution Architect. I am not a developer, but I do like to write code and automate everything I can.

I am also a Microsoft Azure Most Valuable Professional (#MVPBuzz) and Microsoft Certified Trainer. I like creating Infrastructure as a Code, working with Windows server, hyperconverged infrastructures, and Azure :)

### ðŸ“«  Let's get in touch:
