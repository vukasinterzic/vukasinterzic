### Hi there üëã

My name is Vukasin. I am a digital nomad traveling around the world, while working as a Cloud Solution Architect. I am not a developer, but I do like to write code and automate everything I can.

I am also a Microsoft Azure Most Valuable Professional (#MVPBuzz) and Microsoft Certified Trainer. I like creating Infrastructure as a Code, working with Windows server, hyperconverged infrastructures, and Azure ‚òÅÔ∏è

Away from keyboard, I enjoy activities like scuba diving and free diving, kite surfing and wind surfing, paddle boarding, beach cleaning, volunteering to help animals. I'm a father of a beautiful girl. I enjoy coffee ‚òïÔ∏è I love ocean and where ever I go I always come back to it.

### üì´  Let's get in touch:
